## Requirements
- Connected components
- Generate a binarized image
- Label the forest regions with 4-connected neighbor
    - Label each connected component with R/G/B bounding box in output image.
    - Compute the centroid and area of each regions and print the data on output image or command window.
- Use the morphology algorithms to reserve the road
i.e., the output connected component are only one region.
    - Report the length and orientation of the longest axis
- Analyze and print the computational time of your program

> Try to generate Two Programs: C++(without openCV, except R/W image) & C++(use openCV).
